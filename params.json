Build on Android Studio 1.4 Preview with gradle 2.4.\r\n\r\n> The current GitHub master branch is ahead of the Play Store version and maybe unstable/incomplete at some points.\r\n\r\n[![Get Show Java on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.njlabs.showjava \"Get Show Java on Google Play\")\r\n\r\n## About ##\r\nThis is a Java Decompiler that extracts the .java source code from an APK( Android application) file. There are many such decompilers that run on a PC. But, everything either requires you to install some dependencies (or) are hard to use. \r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n\r\n- Runs directly on an android device (4.x and above)\r\n- Select apk from sdcard (or) from a list of installed applications\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Displays code in a clean-syntax-highlighted form\r\n- The decompiled source can easily be copied from the sdcard (source is stored in ShowJava folder in the sdcard)\r\n- Simple source browser with a summary of all decompilation errors\r\n- Each decompiled source file has commented references to classes that could not be decompiled\r\n\r\n## Know Issues ##\r\n1. Does not display the source code properly on devices running 4.0.x (Icecream Sandwich) due to an internal bug in Android.\r\n1. Does not work with system applications in most of the phones (especially one's that are not de-odexed)\r\n1. java.lang.OutOfMemoryError crashes when decompiling large apps on a mobile phone with low ram and Java VM Heap space.\r\n\r\n## Open Source License ##\r\n\r\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise all files in this repository are licensed under the [Apache Software License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
